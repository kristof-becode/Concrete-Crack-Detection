This repository contains code -work in progress- for a use case with the objective of inspecting concrete surfaces from drone images.
The goal is to facilitate the inspection of concrete surfaces on real-world structures, such as buildings, bridges etc, to investigate possible degradation of concrete.

Steps:
- detect cracks present or not
- provide information on cracks present, i.e. size
